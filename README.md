Features:
- 

Limitations:

- development stage: **Alpha**,


Installation
------------

The package is installed from PyPI with::

    $ pip install skinny-wms


System dependencies
--------------------

The python module depends on the ECMWF *Magics* library
that must be installed on the system and accessible as a shared library.
Some Linux distributions ship a binary version that may be installed with the standard package manager.
On Ubuntu 18.04 use the command::

    $ sudo apt-get install libmagplus

As an alternative you may install the official source distribution
by following the instructions at
https://software.ecmwf.int/magics/Installation+Guide

Note that *Magics* support for the Windows operating system is experimental.

You may run a simple selfcheck command to ensure that your system is set up correctly::

    $ python -m Magics selfcheck
    Found: Magics '4.1.2'.
    Your system is ready.
